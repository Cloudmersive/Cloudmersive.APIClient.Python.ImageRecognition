configuration.api_key['Apikey'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['Apikey'] = 'Bearer'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = cloudmersive_image_api_client.RecognizeApi(cloudmersive_image_api_client.ApiClient(configuration))
image_file = '/path/to/file.txt' # file | Image file to perform the operation on.  Common file formats such as PNG, JPEG are supported.
